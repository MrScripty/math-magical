## math-magical
Math for game development and general geometric calculations involving vectors, radians, points, etc.

Most examples are written in python for Blender 2.80+ to demonstrate how to actualy implement the math and let you see the result in 3D. This slowly growing collection is the result of a mathamaticly not so sofisticated mind who after hours even days strugling over simple math issues and not understanding math stack exchange and explanations of other math websites finaly figured out a solution and wrote an easy to use script availible for everyone so we can all finaly stop banging our heads againsed the wall - FOREVER!(TM)
